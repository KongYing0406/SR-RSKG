# SR-RSKG

## Robust deep alignment network with remote sensing knowledge graph for zero-shot and generalized zero-shot remote sensing image scene classification

Rskg.xlsx is the remote sensing domain knowledge graph file constructed in this work

run kg. Py can import rskg. Xlsx into the local neo4j database

Rskg.svg is the result graph after importing

sr-rskg.npy is the representation vector of 70 kinds of remote sensing scenes obtained by TransE based on the Rskg.xlsx
